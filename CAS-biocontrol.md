# Consultancy to Develop Plans for Cycad Aulacaspis Scale Biocontrol

## Problem Definition

Cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS), *Aulacaspis yasumatsui* was first detected on ornamental cycads on Guam in the fall of 2003 but it rapidly spread to Guam's wild, endemic *Cycas micronesica* population and later to wild cycads in the CNMI and Palau. This is a classic case of *escape from natural enemies*. Plant mortality from the scale infestation was severe and progreesed rapidly. *C. micronesica* went from being the most abundant tree (DBH>5") in Guam's forests, to being placed on the IUCN list of threatened species in 2005, to being placed on the US list of endangered and threatened species in 2015. More than 90% of Guam's cycads have been killed to date. A predaceous lady beetle, *Rhizobius lophanthae*, was introduced and is effective in preventing mature plant mortality. However, CAS still infests and kills almost all seedlings. Thus there is currently no recovery of remaining the *C. micronesica* population. Several attempts to introduce parasitoids for CAS biocontrol on Guam have failed, largely because they are outcompeted by *R. lophanthae*.

## Proposal

Funding is requested to support a consulting visit to Guam by Dr. Ron Cave, a recognized expert in CAS biocontrol. The objective of this trip will be to assess the current CAS situation on Guam and to develop a plan for establishment of self-sustaining biological control of CAS aimed at protecting cycad seedlings so that population recovery can begin.

## Partners

* **PI:** Aubrey Moore, University of Guam
* **Cooperator:** Ron Cave, University of Florida
* **Cooperator:** Toni Mizerek, USFWS, Guam
* **Cooperator:** Michael Jordan, USFS, Guam

## Deliverables

* A consulting report detailing a plan for implementation of effective, self-sustaining biocontrol to prevent mortality of *C. micronesica* seedlings on Guam.
* Information and biocontrol agents will be shared with colleagues on other islands. Note that there is an urgent need to rescue the *C. micronesica* germ plasm plantations on Tinian which hav only recently been infested with CAS.

## Budget

$25,000
