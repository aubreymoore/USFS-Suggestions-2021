# Consultancy to Develop Plans for Cycad Aulacaspis Scale Biocontrol

## Problem Definition

Cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS), *Aulacaspis yasumatsui* was first detected on ornamental cycads on Guam in the fall of 2003 but it rapidly spread to Guam's wild, endemic *Cycas micronesica* population and later to wild cycads in the CNMI and Palau. This is a classic case of *escape from natural enemies*. Plant mortality from the scale infestation was severe and progreesed rapidly. **C. micronesica** went from being the most abundant tree (DBH>5") in Guam's forests, to being placed on the IUCN list of threatened species in 2005, to being placed on the US list of endangered and threatened species in 2015. More than 90% of Guam's cycads have been killed to date. A predaceous lady beetle, **Rhizobius lophanthae**, was introduced and is effective in preventing mature plant mortality. However, CAS still infests and kills almost all seedlings. Thus there is currently no recovery of remaining the C. micronesica population.
